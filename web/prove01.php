            <p>I Don't Know How But They Found Me is a band duo consisting of
                Dallon Weekes and Ryan Seaman. 
                They previously were in the band The Brobecks together. The
                Brobecks was founded by Dallon in 2002, and has been largely
                inactive since 2009, with an EP released in 2012.</p>

            <p>The duo's first show, that we know of, was an unanounced show 
                at Emo Nite on Dec 6, 2016. For the next while they teased 
                fans about the bands existence, with a few other unanounced
                shows, as well as cryptic tweets. </p>
            
            
            
            <p>The duo officially aknowledged their bands existence mid-2017
                and headlined their first show July 2017 at the Viper Room.
                They released two singles before signing to a label. </p>
